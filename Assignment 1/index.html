		<h1>Concept</h1>
		</header>

			<p>In today’s ever-evolving world of technology, streaming has become one of the biggest means of providing entertainment to the masses. From videos to music to films, there are infinite amounts of content that is all available at our fingertips. The choices are limitless, but how does it all work? What enables us to be able to have access to hours upon hours of music and movies to enjoy? MU is an educational website that will focus on streaming in the context of music and how it has shaped the way we listen to music.</p>
 
			<p>The target audience for MU would be those who are curious about the technological processes that happen during streaming. I want the design to be easy to consume and read about so that audiences are able to learn about it but also understand the information easily. Since there can be a large amount of technical terms that comes with explaining how the infrastructure of how streaming entertainment works.</p>

			<p>When considering the overall theme and style of the webpage, I want to focus on making it visually easy to understand so that the audience’s attention isn’t distracted by the design aesthetics but is interested so that they can engage with the information being presented. So therefore I will be utilizing pale tones of colours and whites to maintain a minimalist aesthetic. The typography will be one that is easy to read and the layouts of the images and text will be varied between different formats.</p>

		<p><strong>Definition of Streaming:</strong></p>

			<p>Streaming is defined as listening to music (or watching videos) in real time, meaning that there is no file to download as it is a continuous stream of data. Some companies have free services which still work but consumers can pay for better quality services, such as no ads, better sound quality etc.</p>

			<p>Since streaming has been a part of the modern forms of entertainment, there have been several publications discussing the impact of streaming, how it affects the way we listen to music and what it will mean for the future of technology in entertainment going forward.</p>

			<p>In the website, I will link different articles, videos and other information about how streaming has impacted both the music industry’s business model and the technology behind making music possible.</p>

		<p>Logo</p>

			<p>MU stands for “Music Universal”. The logo for MU will just be the word “MU” in all capital lettering in a sans serif font. The main focus for this logo is its readability and being easy to read. There will also be a music note symbol next to the typography in a light blue colour with a circle around it. The circle around the note represents the “World Wide Web” with the music note in the centre representing music, I want the symbol to represent how the way audiences consume music has changed, into something universally available to everyone.</p>

		<p>Typography</p>
		<img src = "MDDN201_logo_design(oxford_blue)-1.png">

		<p>Primary Font</p>

			<p>The primary font is “Times Sans Serif” which is a sans serif font. This font will be used to display headings and titles on the website, the minimalist style of the font makes it appealing to a wide range of audiences and doesn’t distract audiences from the main focus of the website.</p>

		<p>Seondary Font</p>

			<p>The secondary font is “Nordica Hairline” which is also a sans serif font. This font will be used to display subheadings and body text, as well as any references made. Again, I did not want to put too much emphasis on the design aesthetic of the website because I wanted to focus on presenting the information in a way that is easy for people to understand.</p>
